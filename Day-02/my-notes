To make password auth from local to remote(ec2 managed node) follow below steps :

âœ… Hereâ€™s What You Should Do (Step-by-Step)
Step 1 â€” Generate a new key pair on your Mac (control node)

Run this in your Mac terminal:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "ansible"


When prompted:

Save to default location (/Users/leeroy/.ssh/id_rsa)

Leave passphrase empty for now

This will create:

Private key â†’ ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Public key â†’ ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Step 2 â€” Use your existing .pem key to copy the new public key to the remote (managed) node

Run this:

ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -o "IdentityFile ~/Downloads/ansible.pem" ubuntu@54.91.179.20


ðŸ§  What this does:

Uses your .pem key temporarily to authenticate to the EC2 instance

Copies your local public key (id_rsa.pub) to the remote instanceâ€™s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file

After this, you can SSH without using the .pem file

Step 3 â€” Test passwordless SSH

Now try:

ssh ubuntu@54.91.179.20


If setup worked, youâ€™ll log in directly â€” no .pem file or password needed ðŸŽ‰
